Export Logs Script

The export-logs.py script in this repository allows you to retrieve and display logs from a specified Divio environment for a given date range. It uses the Divio API to fetch the logs and displays them on the console and saves them to a text file for easy search and analysis.

For detailed instructions on how to use the export-logs.py script, please refer to the How to Export Logs guide in the documentation https://docs.divio.com/en/latest/how-to/export-logs/.
